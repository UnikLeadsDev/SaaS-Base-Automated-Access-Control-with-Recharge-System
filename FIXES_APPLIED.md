# Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: EmptyBox Component Not Visible

### Problem
The Lottie animation in EmptyBox component was not loading properly, making it invisible on pages.

### Solution
1. **Created SimpleEmptyBox component** - A fallback SVG-based empty state component
2. **Updated all components** to use SimpleEmptyBox instead of EmptyBox for immediate visibility
3. **Enhanced EmptyBox component** with better error handling and fallback SVG

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/Common/SimpleEmptyBox.jsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/components/Common/EmptyBox.jsx` (Enhanced)
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Wallet/Wallet.jsx`

## Issue 2: Form Submission Blocked Despite Having Money

### Problem
Form eligibility check was not properly validating user balance, causing "Form submission blocked" even with sufficient funds.

### Solution
1. **Fixed eligibility check logic** in FormEligibilityCheck.jsx
2. **Updated backend response** to include proper demo mode and payment flags
3. **Simplified form type selection** logic in LoanForm.jsx

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/Forms/FormEligibilityCheck.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Forms/LoanForm.jsx`
- `backend/controllers/walletController.js`

### Key Changes
- Added proper authorization header to balance check API call
- Fixed balance comparison logic (subscription OR sufficient balance)
- Updated backend to return proper default rates (5 for basic, 50 for realtime)
- Added demoMode and paymentsEnabled flags to API response

## Current Status
✅ EmptyBox components now visible on all pages using SimpleEmptyBox
✅ Form submission works when user has sufficient balance
✅ Proper error messages and guidance for insufficient balance
✅ Backend API returns correct eligibility data

## Testing
1. Visit any page with empty data to see the EmptyBox animation
2. Go to `/forms` with sufficient wallet balance to submit forms
3. Try submitting with insufficient balance to see proper error guidance
