# Security Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the SaaS Base application.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Log Injection (CWE-117) - FIXED ✅
**Files affected:** 
- `backend/services/notificationService.js`
- `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Forms/FormEligibilityCheck.jsx`

**Issue:** User inputs were logged without sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate log entries.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added input sanitization for all logged data using regex to remove control characters
- Sanitized user names and form names in notification messages
- Removed sensitive data from console logs in frontend components

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352) - FIXED ✅
**Files affected:**
- `frontend/src/utils/apiWrapper.js`
- `frontend/src/components/TestPayment.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`

**Issue:** Missing CSRF protection on state-changing requests.

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced apiWrapper to automatically include CSRF tokens in POST, PUT, DELETE requests
- Added `X-CSRF-Token` and `X-Requested-With` headers to all state-changing operations
- Replaced direct axios calls with protected apiWrapper calls in all components

### 3. Missing Authorization (CWE-862) - FIXED ✅
**Files affected:**
- `dev-tools/mock-server.js`
- `frontend/src/utils/i18n.js`

**Issue:** Routes lacked proper authorization checks.

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced mock server authentication middleware with proper token validation
- Added role-based access control for admin endpoints
- Improved input validation for user status updates
- Enhanced i18n key sanitization to prevent injection

### 4. Missing Authentication (CWE-306) - FIXED ✅
**Files affected:**
- `dev-tools/mock-server.js`

**Issue:** Critical functions accessible without authentication in mock server.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive authentication middleware
- Implemented proper token format validation
- Added user context to authenticated requests
- Enhanced admin role verification

### 5. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918) - FIXED ✅
**Files affected:**
- `backend/controllers/paymentController.js`

**Issue:** User-provided URLs not validated before requests.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added strict payment ID format validation using regex patterns
- Implemented timeout protection for external API calls
- Added additional SSRF protection with request validation
- Enhanced webhook data validation

### 6. Insecure CORS Policy (CWE-942) - FIXED ✅
**Files affected:**
- `dev-tools/mock-server.js`

**Issue:** Wildcard CORS allowing all origins.

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced wildcard CORS with specific allowed origins
- Added credentials and methods restrictions
- Limited allowed headers for security

### 7. S3 Bucket Sniping Vulnerability - FIXED ✅
**Files affected:**
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`

**Issue:** Potential bucket takeover risk with generic bucket names.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added unique bucket naming requirements with organization prefix
- Included random suffix generation for bucket names
- Added security warnings about bucket takeover attacks
- Implemented proper S3 security configuration

## Security Enhancements Added

### Input Sanitization
- All user inputs are now sanitized before logging or processing
- Control characters and potentially malicious content are filtered out
- HTML entities are properly encoded

### CSRF Protection
- Automatic CSRF token generation and validation
- All state-changing requests now include CSRF tokens
- Enhanced header validation for request authenticity

### Authentication & Authorization
- Proper token format validation
- Role-based access control implementation
- Enhanced middleware for authentication checks

### Request Validation
- Strict input validation for all API endpoints
- Payment ID format validation to prevent SSRF
- Enhanced webhook signature verification

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Log Injection Testing:**
   - Test with malicious input containing control characters
   - Verify logs are properly sanitized

2. **CSRF Testing:**
   - Attempt requests without CSRF tokens
   - Verify all state-changing operations are protected

3. **Authorization Testing:**
   - Test admin endpoints with non-admin users
   - Verify proper role-based access control

4. **SSRF Testing:**
   - Test payment endpoints with malformed payment IDs
   - Verify external request validation

## Production Deployment Notes

1. Ensure all environment variables are properly configured
2. The mock server should NEVER be deployed to production
3. Implement proper rate limiting for API endpoints
4. Consider adding additional security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
5. Regular security audits and dependency updates

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Monitor logs for sanitization effectiveness
2. Track CSRF token validation failures
3. Monitor authentication failures and patterns
4. Set up alerts for potential SSRF attempts

## Additional Security Measures

### CORS Security
- Restricted origins to specific development URLs only
- Disabled wildcard CORS in all environments
- Added proper headers and methods restrictions

### S3 Security
- Mandatory unique bucket naming convention
- Public access blocking by default
- Origin Access Control (OAC) for CloudFront
